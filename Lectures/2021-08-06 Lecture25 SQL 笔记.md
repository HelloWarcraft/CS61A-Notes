# Lecture25 SQL 笔记



## Create Tables

```sqlite
create table parents as 
	select "ham" as parent, "rack" as child union
	select "ham" 		  , "bert";
```

## Project Tables

```sql
select [columns] from [tble] where [condition] order by [order]
```

## Join Tables

> 说到这个必须要把parents和dogs的两个表给列出来，不然难以凭空理解下面的code

```sql
select * from dogs,parents
	where child=name and fur="curly"
```



## Join  a Table with itself

> select all pairs of siblings

```sql
select a.child as first, b.child as second
	from parents as a, parents as b
	where a.parent = b.parent and a.child < b.child
```

> 实际上已经用parents as a和parents as b 把一张表分成两张表了，两张表才有join的情况
>
> 既然Join，如果是一个表，就需要一个表当作两个表来用

## Join multiple Tables

> project a grandpa and grandson Table

```sql
create grandparents as
	select a.parent as granpa, b.child as grandson
		from parents as a, parents as b
		where b.parent=a.child
```

> select all grandparents who has the same fur with their grandson

```sql
select grandpa from grandparents, dogs as c, dogs as d
/*两个dogs，是因为grandparents里的grandpa和grandson要分别跟dogs.name对应起来，然后两个dogs.fur才分别代表grandpa和grandson的毛皮*/
	where grandpa = c.name
		  grandson = d.name
		  c.fur = d.fur
```



## Numerical Expressions

Combine values: `+ - * / % and or`

Transform values: `abs round not -`

Compare values: `< <= > >= <> != =`



## String Expressions

短短5分钟，我竟看不懂，参考一下Chap4.3:[4.3 Declarative Programming (composingprograms.com)](http://composingprograms.com/pages/43-declarative-programming.html)，或者去YouTube搜一下
